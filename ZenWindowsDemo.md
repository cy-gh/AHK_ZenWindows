# Basics

In default settings you simply activate the window you want to focus on and do your thing.

Other windows don't distract unless you mouse hover them.

I personally find a video, podcast, music player or chat programs running in the background distract me less if they become visually less pervasive.


# Move Zen Focus to activated window

Zen focus switches to a new window as soon as you activate it.

You activate another window, it receives the new Zen focus.

But if you want the focus fixed on the window at the time of activation, disable first option.

As you can see the Zen focus was and still is on the settings UI at the time of activating Zen mode (or applying settings).



# Keep active window always opaque

The active window is always opaque in the default settings, mouse hovering other windows keeps it opaque.

But if you want it to become semi-transparent as well, disable 2nd option.



# Auto-activate window under mouse after turning off Zen Mode

An inactive window under mouse cursor gets automatically active when you turn off Zen mode.

If you want to keep the active window as is or didn't have an active window even and keep it that way, Disable 3rd option.



# Run as Administrator

This should be self-explanatory.

It automatically restarts the app in admin mode, so you can manipulate system programs as well, if that Is your style.

# Hidden feature: Virtual Desktops support

Zen Windows also supports Windows Task View & Virtual Desktops. It tries its best to not touch system overlays, such as Alt-Tab, Win-Tab, etc. but if you encounter broken system apps, feel free to contact me.

# Scroll mouse to change transparency

Last but not least you can also press Win key and use mouse scroll wheel to change transparency of a Window with or without zen mode.

Thank you! Hope you enjoy it.
